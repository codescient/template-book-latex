\section{Cultural and Lifestyle Adjustments}

Humans have adapted to the seasons in various ways, from changes in clothing and diet to shifts in social and cultural activities. These adaptations help cope with the environmental challenges posed .

\subsection{Seasonal Foods}

In many cultures, foods consumed vary by season. Winter demands high-energy foods to maintain body heat, while summer calls for lighter meals.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# Simple Python Code to List Seasonal Foods
def listSeasonalFood(season: str) -> str:
	foods = {
		'spring': ['asparagus', 'peas', 'mint'],
		'summer': ['berries', 'melons', 'tomatoes'],
		'autumn': ['apples', 'pumpkins', 'squash'],
		'winter': ['potatoes', 'carrots', 'cabbage']
	}
	return foods[season]
	
# Example usage
print(listSeasonalFood("winter"))
