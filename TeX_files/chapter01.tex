\section{The Four Seasons}

The year is divided into four distinct seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn (or Fall), and Winter. Each season lasts about three months and is characterized by unique weather patterns and daylight hours, which result from the Earth's axial tilt and its orbit around the Sun \cite{SeasonsPlantLife}.

\subsection{Seasonal Changes}

During different times of the year, varying parts of the Earth receive the Sun's direct rays. This variation causes the seasons to change and significantly affects the climate and environment in each region.
