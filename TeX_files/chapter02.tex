\chapter{Effects of Seasons on Wildlife}

\section{Spring and Summer}

Spring and summer are critical times for wildlife, as these seasons are associated with growth and reproduction. Animals emerge from hibernation, birds migrate back from warmer climates, and plants bloom and seed.

\subsection{Wildlife Behavior in Spring}

Spring witnesses the revival of the ecosystem as animals and plants awaken from the winter dormancy. This season is marked by the blossoming of flowers and the birth of new life across animal species.
